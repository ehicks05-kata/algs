1.2.8  Suppose that  a[] and  b[] are each integer arrays consisting of millions of inte-
gers. What does the follow code do? Is it reasonably efficient?

int[] t = a; a = b; b = t;

Answer. It swaps them. It could hardly be more efficient because it does so by copying
references, so that it is not necessary to copy millions of elements.

Answer / Notes:
a is copied to t
b is copied to a
t is copied to b

a ends up with what was at b
b ends up with what was at a

should be efficient as only 3 reference updates were made
