/*
    1.3.38 Delete  k th element. Implement a class that supports the following API:
    public class GeneralizedQueue<Item>
    GeneralizedQueue()  create an empty queue
    boolean isEmpty()  is the queue empty?
    void insert(Item x)  add an item
    Item delete(int k)  delete and return the  k th least recently inserted item
    API for a generic generalized queue
    First, develop an implementation that uses an array implementation, and then develop
    one that uses a linked-list implementation. Note : the algorithms and data structures
    that we introduce in Chapter 3 make it possible to develop an implementation that
    can guarantee that both  insert() and  delete() take time prortional to the logarithm
    of the number of items in the queue—see Exercise 3.5.27.
