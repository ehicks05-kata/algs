    1.3.40 Move-to-front. Read in a sequence of characters from standard input and
    maintain the characters in a linked list with no duplicates. When you read in a previ-
    ously unseen character, insert it at the front of the list. When you read in a duplicate
    character, delete it from the list and reinsert it at the beginning. Name your program
    MoveToFront : it implements the well-known move-to-front strategy, which is useful for
    caching, data compression, and many other applications where items that have been
    recently accessed are more likely to be reaccessed.
